                Hey Tejuuu,<br><br>
Just from our little chat, I feel like you’re someone who really knows how to enjoy the simple things in life. A weekend with PJs, a home-cooked meal, and a good book—ah haan, now that’s my kinda vibe too! Add in some music or late-night talks, and it’s just perfect, isn’t it? ✨

I get what you mean about those little texts that bring a smile to your face. What if I sent you something like, “Just walked by your favorite spot and couldn’t help but think of you,” or “Found a cute café today that I think you’d really love”? Or maybe... “Saw something that made me laugh and thought you’d enjoy it too.” Its really cuteeeee. As we keep chatting, I’m sure I’ll find myself sending you sweet messages like these. 🤭

Runnin’ Down a Dream’ is such a solid choice! It really matches that vibe of always going after what you want, no matter what. I love how it’s all about keeping that energy up and chasing after dreams.💯

Anyway, I’m enjoying getting to know you more. Let’s see where this goes, one little chat at a time. 😊
